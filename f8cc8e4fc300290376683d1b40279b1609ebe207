Task 2: Fix 'Generate Tournament' button not clearing input (#668)

Summary:
Implemented state reset logic in TournamentGeneratorModal to ensure that the form is cleared and restored to default values whenever the modal is hidden.

Changes:
- Added resetForm function to TournamentGeneratorModal.tsx.
- Added useEffect to trigger resetForm when show prop changes to false.
- Created TournamentGeneratorModal-reset.test.tsx to verify reset behavior.
- Cleaned up unused eslint-disable directives.

Why:
Ensures a consistent and predictable user experience by providing a fresh form every time the tournament generator is opened.
