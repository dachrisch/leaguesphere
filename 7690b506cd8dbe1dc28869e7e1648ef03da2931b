Task 3: Fix time selection bug (#670)

Summary:
Improved the robustness of time parsing by supporting the HH:MM:SS format and enhanced the stability of time input fields in the UI.

Changes:
- Updated parseTime in timeCalculation.ts to handle HH:MM:SS format (ignoring seconds).
- Updated isValidTimeFormat regex to support optional seconds.
- Fixed GameTable.tsx to use editedValue during time editing to ensure visible feedback.
- Ensured StageSection.tsx correctly handles empty time values.
- Created format verification tests in timeCalculation.format.test.ts.

Why:
Prevents application crashes and ensures that user time selections are correctly displayed and propagated throughout the designer.
