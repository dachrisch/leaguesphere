Task: Fix button expansion on hover (#680)
Summary: Removed 'btn-adaptive' class and labels from group and team reorder buttons in TeamGroupCard.tsx. These buttons now remain icon-only on hover, preventing disruptive layout shifts and ensuring stable interaction within the group headers and team lists.
