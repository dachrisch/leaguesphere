Task: Create Failing Unit Tests & Implement Color Rotation Logic

Summary:
Implemented automatic color assignment for teams added manually to the team pool, ensuring visual variety and consistency.

Changes:
- Updated addGlobalTeam in useTeamPoolState.ts to calculate a default color using the TEAM_COLORS palette based on the current number of teams (modulo rotation).
- Created useFlowState-manual-colors.test.ts with comprehensive TDD tests for rotation and wrap-around behavior.
- Verified that manual color overrides are preserved and do not interfere with subsequent auto-assignments.

Why:
Ensures a professional and informative UI experience where manually added teams are immediately distinguishable by color, matching the behavior of auto-generated tournaments.
