Task: Hook Decomposition (SRP)
Summary: Refactored the monolithic useFlowState.ts hook (~1000 lines) into specialized sub-hooks to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
Created:
- useNodesState.ts: Manages node CRUD and container hierarchy.
- useEdgesState.ts: Manages edge connections and dynamic reference derivation.
- useTeamPoolState.ts: Manages global team pool and groups.
Refactored useFlowState.ts to orchestrate these specialized hooks while maintaining backward compatibility for existing tests and the UI.
Includes comprehensive unit tests for all new hooks.
Why: Improved maintainability, testability, and clarity by decoupling distinct state domains.
