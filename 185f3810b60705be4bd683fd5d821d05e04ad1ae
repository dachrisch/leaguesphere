Break Duration and Input Propagation Fixes

Summary:
Resolved user confusion regarding game timing by providing explicit control over break durations and ensuring all user inputs are correctly propagated to the tournament generator.

Changes:
- **UI**: Added a 'Break Duration' input to TournamentGeneratorModal, allowing users to specify the pause between games (defaulting to 10m).
- **UI**: Updated the generator preview to show both game duration and break duration.
- **Propagation**: Fixed handleGenerate to pass gameDuration and breakDuration at the top level of the configuration object, ensuring they are seen by the generateTournament function.
- **Generator**: Updated generateTournament to use the nullish coalescing operator (??), which correctly allows 0-minute breaks or durations instead of falling back to template defaults.
- **I18n**: Added German translation for the new break duration label.

Verification:
- Created tournamentGenerator-timing.test.ts to verify that 0-minute values are respected during generation.
- Confirmed that selecting 60m duration and 0m break now correctly schedules the second game 60m after the first (e.g., 10:00 -> 11:00).
