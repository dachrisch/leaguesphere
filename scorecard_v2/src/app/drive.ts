/**
 * Downs, distance and the spot — the series engine.
 *
 * The scorecard records the play (yards included), so down, distance and the
 * ball's position can be derived from the log instead of being typed.
 *
 * The field is the 50-yard flag-football field: the offence's own goal line is
 * 0, midfield is 25 and the opponent's goal line is 50. The spot is shown the
 * way the officials call it: `A12` is the own 12, `M` is midfield and `B14` is
 * the opponent's 14. A series starts at `A5` and its first line to gain is
 * midfield (`1st & M`); once the ball crosses midfield the line to gain is the
 * goal line (`1st & G`) and the B yards count down to `B0`.
 *
 * The spot only changes when a play moves it or the officials set it (a
 * kickoff, a turnover, a correction) — a **Feldposition** row carries it. It
 * moves the ball and keeps the current down: a correction mid-series must not
 * hand out a fresh set of downs. A **1st** comes from reaching the line to
 * gain (midfield, or the goal line in goal-to-go), a new possession or a
 * marker. A penalty also moves the spot: its structured `yardage` is applied
 * to the current spot, never closer than half the distance to either goal
 * line, and a penalty that pushes the ball across midfield starts a fresh
 * `1st & G`.
