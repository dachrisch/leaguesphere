/**
 * "Last server payload + queued ops" — the log the screen shows while the
 * outbox still holds writes.
 *
 * The plan's offline contract is explicit: **the score is never recomputed
 * client-side**. This module therefore never derives a score from the log's
 * events. It keeps the server's score and adds the *delta* of the ops still in
 * the queue, exactly as if they had landed. The next server payload replaces
 * both the rows and the score, which is why nothing here is persisted: a
 * reload rebuilds the same view from the snapshot plus the durable queue.
 *
 * Since slice 2 the queue holds **events**, not play descriptions, so this
 * module also answers "what does this event look like on screen" (via
 * `displayOf` in `./events`) — still only for the delta, never for the base.
 *
 * Synthetic rows carry a negative `id`; {@link ReplayResult.opByEventId} maps
 * each one back to the queued op that produced it, so undoing a row that never
 * reached the server removes the op instead of appending a correction.
