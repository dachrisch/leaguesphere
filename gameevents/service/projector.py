"""Pure projector: events -> game state plus the ``TeamLog`` rows to write.

This module deliberately imports no Django code. ``GameStateValue``,
``TeamLogRow``, ``GameEventValue`` and ``Projection`` are plain dataclasses, so
the meaning of an event can be unit-tested without a database (and the same
code can later run in a worker).

The projected rows reproduce ``gamedays.service.gamelog.GameLogCreator``
exactly -- event names, player, input, value, half, cop, isDeleted, sequence
**and author** -- including its quirks, because every existing consumer
(liveticker, statistics, match report, league table) reads ``TeamLog`` and must
not notice the switch. The author a row is written with is an input (the
event's actor), not a constant: the legacy writer stores the request user, so a
projection that used ``TeamLog``'s ``default=1`` would silently reassign plays
and break on a database whose user table has no id 1. See
``gameevents/tests/golden_cases.py`` for the fixture table and
``test_projector_golden.py`` for the comparison against the real writers.

Grouping / sequence
-------------------
``Projection.rows`` are to be inserted; ``Projection.deleted_sequences`` and
``Projection.restored_sequences`` name existing ``TeamLog.sequence`` groups the
caller must mark ``isDeleted=True`` / ``False`` in place. Rows are never
deleted physically.

The unit of grouping is the **submission**, not the event: one legacy POST
carries a touchdown and its conversion and the legacy writer stores both with
one ``TeamLog.sequence``. A submission is identified by its events sharing one
``client_id``; ``project_submission`` assigns every row it produces one
sequence, the smallest event ``seq`` in that submission (event ``seq`` values
are per-game, strictly increasing, and the first event of a submission is
therefore unique). Excluded rows (``Strafe``, ``Spielzeit``, ``Auszeit``,
``First Down``) and the period markers keep sequence 0, exactly as today.
``apply`` is the per-event entry point: it projects state/score and rows, but
leaves ``TeamLogRow.sequence`` at 0 until ``project_submission`` assigns it.

Corrections
-----------
A ``correction`` inserts no row. It resolves its target event to the target's
legacy sequence and returns that sequence in ``deleted_sequences`` (or, when
the target is itself a correction, in ``restored_sequences``); it also reverses
the target's score effect. The target row is never removed.

A target whose rows live in the *shared* sequence 0 (a penalty, a clock, a
timeout, a marker) is named **by its event**, not by the sequence: every one of
them shares that bucket, so a sequence delete would wipe them all. The effect
then carries the target's ``seq`` in ``deleted_rows``/``restored_rows``, and the
service marks the one row the target wrote (``GameEvent.team_log``).

The service that loads a stored correction must resolve two things for the
projector:

- ``GameEventValue.legacy_sequence`` on the target (the sequence of the
  target's submission), and
- ``GameEventValue.undo_rows`` with the rows the target's legacy sequence
  currently projects, so undoing a touchdown+conversion group reverses the
  whole group's score. Empty ``undo_rows`` means "project the target alone";
  rows already marked ``isDeleted`` are not subtracted.

Undoing a correction restores the sequences the first correction deleted and
adds back the score it removed, so an undo of an undo is symmetric.

Envelope -> projected row (slice 1)::

    score / touchdown              -> Touchdown (6)
    score / pat1, pat2, overtime   -> 1-Extra-Punkt, 2-Extra-Punkte, Overtime
    score / safety + payload.points-> Safety (+1) / Safety (+2)
    penalty / <penalty name>       -> Strafe, input=<penalty name>
    series / first_down            -> First Down
    possession / turnover          -> Turnover (cop)
    possession / interception      -> Interception (cop)
    possession / home, away        -> state only (no TeamLog row)
    timeout / home, away           -> Auszeit, input from payload
    time / clock                   -> Spielzeit, input from payload
    period / start, half_time, end -> Spiel gestartet / 2. Halbzeit gestartet /
                                      Spiel beendet (half=0, no team)
    correction / undo              -> deleted/restored sequences, no row

``series`` is not in the plan's short type list, but scorecard v2 sends First
Down today and the golden test must reproduce its row; it is the smallest
addition that keeps the vocabulary honest. ``pat1``/``pat2`` use distinct codes
while safety carries ``payload.points``: that asymmetry is deliberate until
slice 2's sport definitions replace both.

Only user-data problems raise the typed ``InvalidEnvelope`` /
``UnsupportedEventCode``; the append endpoint maps those to 400. Bugs surface
as ordinary exceptions (500).
