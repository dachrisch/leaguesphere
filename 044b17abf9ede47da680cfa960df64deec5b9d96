Task 3: Fix time selection bug (#670)

Summary:
Improved the robustness of time parsing by supporting the HH:MM:SS format, which is often returned by HTML5 time inputs in certain browsers.

Changes:
- Updated parseTime in timeCalculation.ts to handle strings with three components (ignoring seconds).
- Updated isValidTimeFormat in timeCalculation.ts to accept optional seconds component via regex.
- Created timeCalculation.format.test.ts to verify support for various time formats.

Why:
Prevents application crashes when a browser returns a time string with seconds, ensuring the gameday designer remains stable during time selection.
