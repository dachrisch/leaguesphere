Task: Audit and optimize re-renders in ListCanvas and its child sections.
Summary: Applied React performance best practices to the main list-based UI components to ensure smooth interactions even with large tournament schedules.
Changes:
- Wrapped ListCanvas, FieldSection, StageSection, and GameTable in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when parent state changes but relevant props don't.
- Converted all inline handlers to useCallback to maintain stable references across renders.
- Optimized data derivation (filtering/sorting nodes) using useMemo.
- Restored essential accessibility attributes (aria-label, title) that were accidentally removed during initial refactoring.
Verified: All vitest suites passed, and manual verification confirmed correct behavior.
